# Personal Knowledge Management Base

---

Repository to host/version control my zettlekasten and link-intensive module notes at university.

These notes are meant to be a distilled version of the math I've learnt where ideas, formulations, and important results are broken down into their atomic components of definitions, propositions, and theorems for clarity, precision, and accessibility.
